You dont see with your iris.

How do I turn these into quotes....?

>You're a quote.

###### Hi Rocco. I'm sorry in advance if I make 20 blog posts on here this weekend and they're all nonsense. I'm worn out and excited to be stepping out of college this week. Thanks for taking that chance on me last summer, I really appreciate everything I've learned and the opporitunity you gave me. 

#### Further, I'm going to turn this project into a display of the mess that is my mind. 👍
