### Hello and welcome to the first installment of _Music Month_ !!!

This is where I'll just go on and on about my monthly listening habits on the last day of the month. Typically you can get a peek at this if you follow me on Twitter, I'll be mentioning an album I've liked here and there, or weeping over Ian Curtis. 

My music taste for the last few weeks has been mostly a flip between two genres:

<span class="alsoBeeg">Melodic Prog Metal</span> and <span class="alsoBeeg">Goth Rock</span>

There has been no inbetween.

#### Let's start with what was the focus earlier in the month.

A stark contrast to the end of March, where the majority of my listening was Alternative R&B (though my boyfriend is quite particular on what I consider any kind of R&B cause he's an early 2000's purist), I decided to delve back into my #EmoRoots and dig out some heavier stuff. 

Since the beginning of the year, I've been listening pretty regularly to Deadrose by Unprocessed, it's a beautiful song, and also great if you wanna try out some djent-prog stuff, because of it's edm-style intro which is pretty tame. This inspired me to try out Spotify's radios until I found more music like this- but that only got me so far. Vocals in metal are so dynamic, but fit into only a few categiories. 

**1.** Angry-I-Eat-Lead-Every-Morning-For-Breakfast-Without-Any-Milk-Listen-To-My-Unintelligible-Growling

**2.**Hi-I'm-An-Angsty-Teenager-Who-Wants-To-Do-Screamo-But-My-Band-Only-Listens-To-Metallica-So-My-Voice-Doesn't-Match-The-Music-At-All

**3.** Female

**4.** Angry but comprehensible, border-line operatic but still modern, great range, absolute ****chef's kiss****

##### The above catagories are 100% in order of how I like them from least to most.

AND THIS IS WHERE I WENT TO REDDIT!!!

Reddit is beautiful, such a huge community of people who share music that is like other music. I wanted something with heavy vibes. I'm still working on the playlist but I mean ths was the vibe I was going for:

The main thing that I was listening to on repeat was that album by <span class="alsoBeeg">Alaya</span>. Would totally recommend it, the vocals are heavy but in no way harsh- it's got strong drums, interesting guitar riffs. It's a very strong display of my favourite kind of metal.

#### Now onto the Goth Rock!

If you know anything about me, I would hope that you know about my love for New Wave (Thank you, my dear father for having good taste in music and showing me <span class="alsoBeeg">The Cure</span> and <span class="alsoBeeg">New Order</span> at a young age). In the last few years I've been growing my repetiour of New Wave music and 80's Synth-Pop as much as possible because I am convinced that it was the peak of all music ever made and nobody can tell me otherwise because my opinion is correct and anyone who says anything else is dumb and wrong. (Takes a very deep breath)

I was listening to <span class="alsoBeeg">New Order's</span> early discography, the _Movement_ era, right after <span class="alsoBeeg">Joy Division</span> disbanded after Ian Curtis died. This made me span into the Joy Division discography too and just listen to everything. I've had my favourite songs but I had to listen to more. After listening to them, <span class="alsoBeeg">Sisters of Mercy</span>, a little <span class="alsoBeeg">Bauhaus</span>, I needed to know if there are any good pure Goth artists out there. AND THERE ARE!! This shouldn't be much of a surprise to me considering my obsession with <span class="alsoBeeg">Crystal Castles</span> when I was younger- specifically their song with Robert Smith, _Not In Love_, which is actually a cover from <span class="alsoBeeg">Platinum Blonde</span>, who aren't Goth but they are on that line of Pop-Rock/New Wave with a dash of Joico Ice. Crystal Castles are much more Synth-Pop and Electronic oriented, but I digress. Modern Goth Rock.

What do <span class="alsoBeeg">Joy Division</span> and <span class="alsoBeeg">Sisters of Mercy</span> both have in common? Not only some hekkin bops, but unique bass-baritone vocal registers that aren't super common nowadays. That's when I found <span class="alsoBeeg">Drab Majesty</span>, my first listen being _Out of Sequence_, which compliments the traditional Goth Rock so perfectly. 

>> Why do people think Goth Music is angry and dark and yelling and screaming? It isn't. Like a good amount of the Goth community listen to that, but that's more the Emo side of things. The Emo community sort of ranges from Alt-Pop stuff like **Panic! At The Disco** or **Jimmy Eat World** or Emo-Rock like **Fall Out Boy** and **My Chemical Romance**, or Screamo like **Hawthorne Heights**. Goth is a completely seprate genre. Just a disclaimer.

Here's my Goth playlist on Spotify. 10/10 totally recommend:

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/6MJChgP8IaRpDoxTW8aXLW" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

There's actually a pretty big range in this playlist. Years are anywhere from 1981 with <span class="alsoBeeg">Siouxsie and the Banshees</span>' _Monitor_, a bit heavier of a beat, still the strong wailing, nice bridges and breakdowns, a little more experimental. The most recently made tracks are from <span class="alsoBeeg">Drab Majesty</span>'s _Modern Mirror_, at 2019. I really respect how all of this melds together despite the nearly 40 years of time that pass between some of the songs in this genre. The more contemporary still sound modern and have the UK-Indie sound you hear pretty often, but allow the Goth influence to shine so well.

In the genre range you have late 80's Goth Rock with stronger guitars in the <span class="alsoBeeg">Sisters of Mercy</span> track, _More_, which I learned recently was also covered by <span class="alsoBeeg">Meatloaf</span> of all people, haha. You've also got the <span class="alsoBeeg">Killing Joke</span> anthem, _Love Like Blood_, and possibly my current favourite song- _Wax and Wane_ by Scottish Dream-Pop band <span class="alsoBeeg">Cocteau Twins</span>. The singer of which, Elisabeth Fraser (who has a really sad upbringing, might I add), utilizes the Scottish *puirt Ã  beul* style of singing, which is utilized more as an instrument and assisting the melodicy of the song rather than convaying a lyrical message. Pretty much, a lot of their songs have lyrics really hard to understand, and that's because you're not supposed to. They do it to highlight vocal dexterity and make the song sound that much better! 

All in all, Goth music is super cool. It's made up a lot of my April, and it'll probably make a reappearance in May as well.
